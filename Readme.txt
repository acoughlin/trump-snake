The arrow keys control the centipede. Up to go up, Down to go down, Left to go left, Right to go right. Hitting powerups will remove the latter half of your snake. If you last for a minute, you win. No, it isn't very difficult.

A simple game created for a python introduction project. Lost a bet, had to make my next class project trumpcentric. I supposed it could have been worse(it could have Jeb!centric). For the most part it is glitch-free, occasionally there may be a bug related to parts of the snake seperating from the head and running away.

I did not create the graphics.py module. It was written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates). I also do not own rights to the images used, they were taken off google and cropped.
